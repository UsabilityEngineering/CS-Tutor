## Methods

Survey

We chose conducting a survey in order to reach a wider audience of students that have interacted with the tutoring system.

Interviews

We chose interviews because we have enough time to meet one on one with professors/faculty in order to find out what different services they use and how they accomplish different tasks they have.
