# Requirements Gathering

## Methods

**Survey**

We chose to conduct a survey in order to reach a wider audience of students that have interacted with the tutoring system. Since a survey is more casual, and can get a wider range of responses, we felt it would be appropriate to use surveys for the student side of our research project, since we would not be able to get a decently representative sample of the student population in the time we had.

**Interviews**

We chose interviews because we have enough time to meet one on one with professors/faculty in order to find out what different services they use and how they accomplish different tasks they have. The interviews helped us to define the problem space we would be working in, so that we could get an understanding of our project's scope. It also gave us a more holistic perspective of the process, as we were able to see the different occupations that contributed to the scheduling and payroll system.

## Findings

From our survey (n=12), we found 58.3% of students are interested in tutoring, but only 28.6% of those students have actually interacted with the tutoring system here at CSU Chico. Of the students that interacted with the system, most of them were slightly dissatisfied with it. Some of the reasons that students have not interacted with the tutoring system were time constraints, not enough hours available, and not knowing where to go to get tutoring.

From the faculty members that we interviewed (n=3), we found that the system for scheduling and payroll is extremely dissatisfying and inefficient. There is lots of back and forth between student workers and faculty members through email. Three different faculty members used the word "cumbersome" to describe the system. Depending on the occupation of the person interviewed, their level of satisfaction varied. Those working to process incoming data were the most displeased with the process. Those who had to manage student workers felt moderately inconvenienced, and those inputting data into the system that had already been processed felt only a little inconvenienced. 

We also collected data on the process of filling out timesheets, and the various steps they took as they were passed around from staff member to staff member. This is ultimately a manual task, and does not handle well when disrupted by a change in schedule. Time sheets must also be manually approved, which in its current format, spread between various services, is a cumbersome task. The person processing data from these timesheets did not speak highly of the system. These timesheets are manually e-mailed back and forth, which leaves the system prone to error and delay. Students are not trusted to enter in their own time, so this takes forever. Re-scheduling is done directly with a supervisor, and lab assistants must contact faculty.

The current database system runs on Peoplesoft, and entering data that has already been manually processed into it is the duty of another person. This person feels that the task is fairly simple, although the training required to do this simple task is extensive, even if it is easy. The most common task for the person entering manually processed data to the digital database is dealing with timesheets, and there are a lot of important details and rules that must be followed at all steps of the process. The biggest issue with the system is memorability. 

Lab instructors have a collective bargaining unit, so when there is a gap in scheduling, people can't always be replaced if they belong to this unit. Getting a replacement depends on who is in the office.

## Conclusions

Our survey showed that we must come to understand why people are not receiving tutoring if they are interested in it. As time constraints are a large portion of this, it may help to investigate ways in which the scheduling portion of the system can be made quickly accessible. It may also be worth finding ways to spread the word about the tutoring program, although we do not currently know the best method for this.

Learnability and memorability may be an area to explore for this project. One interviewee mentioned the existing application has extreme issues with this, and requires extensive training to do things that are simple and routine. Participants have either been through extensive training, or have been using the system for many years, and we should prioritize a seamless transition to reduce the frustration of re-learning. 

The requirement for the manual input of information hints that there may be redundancies in the system, as it is currently required that certain people process information and then separate people input information into the system. This may also simplify the persona generation stage, as we only have to account for people managing student workers, and the student workers themselves. Data suggests students may also be a consideration for persona generation if this becomes a large enough part of the project.

Finding a replacement when scheduling issues arise is an area that could be further investigated. Previous data from interviews suggests that while it is not super common, it is disruptive and "annoying," even to those who found the current system overall less frustrating.

## Caveats

Our sample size was limited in both the number of responses we received for the survey and interview portions of our research. This may hint that our survey needs to be redesigned. This combined with showcasing the survey in other areas might help to increase our sample size. 

The biggest caveat we came up against was time constraints, as we had to build leads for our interviews, which then took time to schedule. Each interviewee helped us to broaden our reach, and even an additional week to gather information might help exponentially because of this.
