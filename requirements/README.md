# Requirements Gathering

## Methods

Survey

We chose conducting a survey in order to reach a wider audience of students that have interacted with the tutoring system.

Interviews

We chose interviews because we have enough time to meet one on one with professors/faculty in order to find out what different services they use and how they accomplish different tasks they have.

## Findings

From our survey, we found about 60% of students are interested in tutoring, but only 30% of those students have actually interacted with the tutoring system here at CSU Chico. Of the students that interacted with the system, most of them were slightly dissatisfied with it. Some of the reasons that students have not interacted with the tutoring system were time constraints, not enough hours available, and not knowing where to go to get tutoring.

From the faculty members that we interviewed, we found that the system for scheduling and payroll is extremely dissatisfying and inefficient. There is lots of back and forth between student workers and faculty members through email.
