# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Executive Summary**

The project's goal is to **make the scheduling and payroll process for student workers easier** for both faculty and the student workers themselves. In this requirements gathering phase, we reached out to different faculty members as well as students to get a grasp of how the current system works as of now.

We interviewed **faculty members** to better understand how the current system works and to find out how satisfied they were with the current system.

* Chico State **faculty members (n = 3)** participated in 1-on-1 interviews
* All faculty members felt the current system is extremely **cumbersome**
* 

We surveyed Chico State students to find out how many people have interacted with the current tutoring system and to see how satisfied they were with the current system.

* Online survey received **(n = 12) students' responses**
